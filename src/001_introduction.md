Introduction
============

High level points

* Tool for protocol analysis: verification and falsification of
  cryptographic protocols
* Scope: protocols, attackers, properties.  (high level!)
* Limitations, e.g., symbolic model, large search space, may not
  terminate.
* But yet highly successful.   How it distinguishes itself from
  other tools.
* Who is this written for?  Our expectations for reader and where
  additional information can be found for those readers with fewer
  prerequisites.
