Limitations {#sec:limitations}
===========

TODO:
  * Shortcomings - A list of things you definitely can't ever get Tamarin to
    do / what you can't get it to do yet. A useful section in any software.

TODO:
  * Warning - Virtualised Tamarin has significant overhead due to Haskell
    virtualisation 'bad stuff' (seems to make a lot of system calls) [Ask Cas/Dennis/Kevin for more on this]


*Add something about limitations: 
e.g., symbolic model, large search space, may not
terminate.*
