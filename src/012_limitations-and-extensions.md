Limitations
===========

Explain limitations and planned extensions


TODO:
  * Shortcomings - A list of things you definitely can't ever get Tamarin to
    do / what you can't get it to do yet. A useful section in any software.


Current Limitations
-------------------

TODO:
  * Warning - Virtualised Tamarin has significant overhead due to Haskell
    virtualisation 'bad stuff' (seems to make a lot of system calls) [Ask Cas/Dennis/Kevin for more on this]



Planned Extensions
------------------
